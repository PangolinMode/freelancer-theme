description: While working on monthly content for DIRECTV, I had the opportunity to interview lieutenant Joe Kenda of "Homicide Hunter". By the time the final season rolled around, he'd already answered every question you could ask about his career, so instead, we created an IG story series where he gave his blunt but spot on advice, all in the setting of a calming spa to keep the viewer at ease while absorbing life's harsh truths. We also made a fun Christmas video with him if you're in the holiday spirit.
