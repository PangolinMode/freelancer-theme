description: When I realized how odd it was that the only pride flag in the emoji keyboard is the rainbow flag, I developed this petition to gain support online for an easy way to add more identities to give greater representation. The campaign was further boosted by the support of LGBTQIA+ Fullscreen talent like Miles McKenna and Perez Hilton in a launch video that I scripted.
