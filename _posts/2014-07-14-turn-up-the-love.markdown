description: In 2019, AT&T put a greater focus on their LGBTQ+ outreach with the campaign "#TurnUpTheLove". As part of this initiative, I went to five events (PSIFF, Sundance, GLAAD Media Awards, GLAAD Media Awards, Utah Pride, and LOVELOUD Music Festival) and captured real-time IG story content for @AT&T, as well as oversaw premium in-feed content used organically and in paid media.
