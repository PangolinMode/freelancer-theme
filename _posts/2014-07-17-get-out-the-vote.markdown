description: OMEN seeks to use their handles for good, and one initiative they were interested in championing was early voting during a pandemic where avoiding crowds is so important. We developed these stickers for their audience to spread the passion for civic duties. We even made Zoom backgrounds and a video featuring their influencers to urge people to make a plan.
